    <h3>Calorie Checker</h3>
    <p>
        Use <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/calorie-checker/">this NHS tool</a> to learn more about the calorie contents of different foods.
        The number of calories food has is to do with how much energy is in the food. Higher calories is a higher amount of energy, but eating too many calories in a day can mean you are taking in more energy than you use.
        Extra unused energy is converted to body fat.
